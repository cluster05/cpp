TREE : 

TREE is collection of nodes where one of the node taken as ROOT node
rest of nodes devided into collection of disjoint subset. and each subset 
is node or tree.

            A
        /   |   \
       B    D    C
    /    \      /  \
   E      F    G    H

 
Terminology  :
ROOT        : A
Parent      : A < B,D,C
Child       : 
Siblings    : B,C,D ( Children of same Parent)
Decendence  : A > All node  ( Node can be reach from perticular node )
Ancesters   : All Node from that node to root node 
Degree      : Number of Children
Internal Node : Degree > 0  
External Node : Degree == 0 leaf Node
Leavel      : 1 , 2 , 3
Height      : 0 , 1 , 2
Forest      : when we remove root node remaing tree called Forest

Binary TREE: Evary Node two or less than two node;

Left Sckewed Binary Tree ( only left child )
Right Sckewed Binary Tree ( only right child )
