Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.
Encapsulation also leads to data abstraction or hiding.

    Eg : Company > sale , fainance , developer , Business

Abstraction :
Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details.
Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data
to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.

     Eg : Car > break > inner machanism

Polymorphism :
The word polymorphism means having many forms.
In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the
ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

Eg . Person > father, a husband, an employee

Inheritance:
The capability of a class to derive properties and
characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.
Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.

Example: Dog, Cat, Cow can be Derived Class of Animal Base Class.

Dynamic Binding:
In dynamic binding, the code to be executed in response
to function call is decided at runtime.
